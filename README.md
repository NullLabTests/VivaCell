# VivaCell

VivaCell is a Haskell-based cellular automaton that draws inspiration from Conway's Game of Life. The project was created as a way to explore and familiarize myself with Haskell while incorporating vibrant and dynamic patterns in a cellular grid.

## Features:
- Cellular automaton running on a grid of cells that evolve over time.
- Colorful animations that run indefinitely until stopped.
- User can interact by drawing on the grid and starting the simulation.

## Inspirations:
This project is heavily inspired by Conway's Game of Life, which is a well-known example of a cellular automaton. It was built to get familiar with Haskell's strengths and libraries like Graphics.Gloss.

## Demo Video:
